Here we have:\
Barrier_out - a function applied to any generated Monte Carlo prices, which filter out stock prices which have hit the barrier, and subsequently discards the payoff to price down-and-out Eurpoean Call options \
Black_Scholes_European_price - gives the price of a European Call and Put option using vectorised Monte Carlo methods, and checks the result using the Analytical Black-Scholes prices \
Heston_European_Option_price - Uses the Heston stochastic volatility model in a Monte Carlo simulation in conjunction with a fully truncated Milstein discretization to accurately price European options
